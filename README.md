# Java Streams API

## Course Description
Functional programming is quite popular, and it focuses around pure functions. Functional applications avoid the shared state, and tend to be more concise and predictable than those using object-oriented code. In this tutorial Nelson/Amigoscode teaches how to move away from imperative to declarative programming allowing us to write less code and focus on what is important when build applications.
